<p>It is evident that in all countries, the large majority of headlines relate to <em>Covid-19</em> and <em>Christmas</em>. In all countries, the usage of words related to these topics fluctuated heavily. This is due to the fact that new developments constantly arise with regards to these topics, such as: what will be the effect of the omicron variant and will we be able to visit our families during Christmas?</p>
