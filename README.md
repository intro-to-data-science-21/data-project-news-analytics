# News analytics
## Summary

This repository provides materials for our final data science project for the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

## Our main question: How does the news cycle evolve over time?
We aim to answer this question with the following subquestions:
- How often are certain words used?
- How long remain certain words included in the headlines?
- How do the answers to the questions above change per country?

## Repo
- In the "Data" folder you can find the headlines that we scriped in the csv. files.
- The "final-report.rmd" is the rmd file that produces our final report - including all (plotly) figures and text.
- The "master-scraping-script.rmd" contains the code that we used to schedule our scraping.
